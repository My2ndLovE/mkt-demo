## Common Betting Systems

The following betting systems are available across multiple lottery operators in Malaysia and Singapore:

---

### 1. Big Bet vs Small Bet

**Availability:** Malaysia (Magnum, Sports Toto, Damacai), Singapore (Singapore Pools 4D)

**Big Bet (Malaysia: ABC)**
- Covers all 5 prize categories
- Higher chance to win (23 winning numbers)
- Lower prize amounts
- Prize categories: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, Starter/Special (10), Consolation (10)

**Small Bet (Malaysia: A)**
- Covers top 3 prize categories only
- Lower chance to win (3 winning numbers)
- Higher prize amounts (approximately 40% more)
- Prize categories: 1st, 2nd, 3rd only

**Strategy:**
- Big Bet: Better for casual players seeking any win
- Small Bet: Better for confident players seeking higher returns
- Many players bet on both for balanced coverage

---

### 2. iBox / iBet (Permutation Betting)

**Availability:** Malaysia (all operators), Singapore (Singapore Pools 4D)

**How It Works:**
- Covers all permutations of your selected 4-digit number
- Single payment covers all combinations
- Prizes divided by number of permutations
- Most cost-effective way to play permutations

**Permutation Types:**

| Type | Description | Example | Permutations | Cost |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------|------|
| iBox/iBet 24 | 4 different digits | 1234 | 24 | $1/RM1 total |
| iBox/iBet 12 | 1 pair, 2 different | 1123 | 12 | $1/RM1 total |
| iBox/iBet 6 | 2 pairs | 1122 | 6 | $1/RM1 total |
| iBox/iBet 4 | 3 same, 1 different | 1112 | 4 | $1/RM1 total |

**Prize Calculation:**
Prize = (Standard Prize ÷ Number of Permutations)

**Example (Singapore 4D iBet):**
- Number: 1234 (24 permutations)
- If 1234 wins 1st Prize Big Bet
- Standard Prize: $2,000
- iBet Prize: $2,000 ÷ 24 = $83

---

### 3. iPerm (Permutation with Individual Payment)

**Availability:** Sports Toto, Damacai

**How It Works:**
- Similar to iBox but each permutation costs separately
- Higher total cost than iBox
- Each combination has full prize potential (not divided)

**Cost Calculation:**
Total Cost = Number of Permutations × Bet Amount per Number

**Example:**
- Number: 1234 (24 permutations)
- Bet: RM1 per number
- Total Cost: 24 × RM1 = RM24
- If 1234 wins 1st Prize: Full RM2,500 (not divided)

**iPerm vs iBox:**
- iPerm: Higher cost, higher potential winnings
- iBox: Lower cost, divided winnings
- iPerm suitable for serious players with larger budgets
